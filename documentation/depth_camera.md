# Setup and use a simulated depth camera.
Congratulations, you've reached the last of the basic level tutorials. Recalling what you have learned so far, we can say that you already know how to move the robot using a GUI, how to include boxes and pallets in the simulation environment, how to grab boxes, and how to record the robot's poses by measuring value. of the joints

In this tutorial we will learn how to use a depth camera through a gazebo plugin, the missing piece in the system that will allow us to detect incoming boxes and perform a palletizing mission using manual (non-autonomous) human control.
